# My Approach for this task

This was a bit edgy or different for me. At first it all seemed pretty good as simple but the problems started when i had to make new repos and stuff. That took some time but before that, figuring out how all these themes and stuff worked was another cahllenge. i had to try different themes and at last i found this one out. thankfully, it didnt have problems i faced with the other themes and the operation was smooth. I did enjoy making this and its a pretty neat task in my openion.
