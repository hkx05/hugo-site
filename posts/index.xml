      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Harikrishna TP I&amp;rsquo;m currently a b.tech CSE student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I&amp;rsquo;m making this webiste as part of my amfoss praveshan task and it seems like im certainly enjoying it !.
My Journey I came to this college without knowing much about its student club background. but, when I came to know more about it, i was very impressed and particularly interested aswell. I want a taste of amfoss and I&amp;rsquo;m doing this to make myself a part of that beautiful community.</description>

      <description>My Approach for this task This was a bit edgy or different for me. At first it all seemed pretty good as simple but the problems started when i had to make new repos and stuff. That took some time but before that, figuring out how all these themes and stuff worked was another cahllenge. i had to try different themes and at last i found this one out. thankfully, it didnt have problems i faced with the other themes and the operation was smooth.</description>
